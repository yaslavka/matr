# CoreUI Free React MATRIX Template v4

CoreUI is meant to be the UX game changer. Pure & transparent code is devoid of redundant components, so the app is light enough to offer ultimate user experience. This means mobile devices also, where the navigation is just as easy and intuitive as on a desktop or laptop. The CoreUI Layout API lets you customize your project for almost any device – be it Mobile, Web or WebApp – CoreUI covers them all!


### Instalation

``` bash
$ npm install
```

or

``` bash
$ yarn install
```

### Basic usage

``` bash
# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:3000
$ npm start 

# if you use Node 17+ use this command instead of `npm start`
$ npm run start:n17 
```

or 

``` bash
# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:3000
$ yarn start

# if you use Node 17+ use this command instead of `yarn start`
$ yarn start:n17 
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
